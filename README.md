# üîí FileEncrypt
_Open source file encryption software_  

This code consts of two files:
* `encrypt.py`
* `decrypt.py`

## How to encrypt
‚úÖ You should contain all the files you want to encrypt in a folder. For instance:  

`Folder1`  
|  
|--- `file.txt`  
|--- `Spreadsheet.xlsx`  
|--- `image.png`  

‚ùå You shouldn't contain an other folder inside of the parent folder.  
`Folder1`  
|  
|--- `Folder2`  
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|--- `example.pdf`  
|--- `file.txt`  
|--- `Spreadsheet.xlsx`  
|--- `image.png`  
The program will return an error. If you wish to encrypt a folder, zip it and place the zip in the parent folder.

Once your environment is set up, you can run the script.  
`$ python3 encrypt.py`  
The program will start. *Make sure you have python3 installed*

On startup, the program will ask you for the location of the folder containing the files to encrypt. Make sure to write the exact location of the parent folder:  
* In linux: `/home/username/Desktop/Folder1`  
* In windows: `C:\\Username\\Desktop\\Folder1`

Once you provided the file path, it will ask you if you are sure to proceed. If you answer `y` it will continue. Otherwise, it wont.
If you selected `y`, the program will generate a 'key'. This key shall remain kept secret and safely stored, because:  
* The files can be decrypted *ONLY* with this key.  
* Anyone with the key can decrypt and access the files.  

Safely storing your key is recommended. You can use Bitwarden to store your key.  
  
To make sure the key has been copied, it will ask you to confirm the key. Following, the files will be encrypted. The program will show a message of confirmation.

## How to decrypt
Initialazing the decrypt file will start the decryption process. You MUST have the correct key for decrypting the files. Otherwise, you won't be able to decrypt.  
`$ python3 decrypt.py`  
After that, the program will ask you for the path of the containing folder.  
Next, provide your key.  
If the key is correct, your files will be decrypted.
