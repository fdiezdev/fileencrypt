 ReEncryptingMode
 1. Use this tool under your own risk. The developers are not responsible for the data loss caused by users.
 2. This tool is intended to ONLY encrypt FILES, NOT FOLDERS. If you wish to encypt a folder, first you must zip it.

 This script is for using only when you already have an encryption key and you want to re encrypt your files with the same key.
